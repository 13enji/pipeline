    <h2>What is Tidepooling?</h2>
    <p>Tidepooling is the recreational activity of exploring rocky intertidal zones during low tide. When the ocean recedes, it leaves behind shallow pools filled with marine life - sea stars, anemones, crabs, sea urchins, and much more.</p>
    <p>The best tidepooling happens during very low tides, typically below 1 foot. These "negative tides" expose areas that are normally underwater, revealing the richest diversity of creatures.</p>

    <h2>How Tides Work</h2>
    <p>Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on Earth's oceans. Most coastal areas experience two high tides and two low tides each day.</p>
    <p><strong>Key concepts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tide height</strong> is measured in feet relative to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW)</li>
        <li><strong>Negative tides</strong> (below 0 ft) expose the most marine life</li>
        <li><strong>Spring tides</strong> occur during full and new moons, producing the most extreme highs and lows</li>
        <li><strong>Neap tides</strong> occur during quarter moons, with less dramatic tidal swings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tidepooling Etiquette</h2>
    <p>Tide pools are fragile ecosystems. Following these guidelines helps protect them for future generations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Look, don't take.</strong> Leave all creatures and shells where you find them</li>
        <li><strong>Watch your step.</strong> Walk on bare rock, not on organisms. Mussels and barnacles are living creatures!</li>
        <li><strong>Touch gently.</strong> If you touch an anemone or sea star, do so with one wet finger only</li>
        <li><strong>Replace rocks.</strong> If you flip a rock to look underneath, carefully return it to exactly how you found it</li>
        <li><strong>Keep pools clean.</strong> Don't add anything to tide pools - no sunscreen-covered hands, no food, no trash</li>
        <li><strong>Respect closures.</strong> Some areas are marine protected areas (MPAs) with additional restrictions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Bring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sturdy footwear</strong> - Water shoes or old sneakers with good grip. Rocks are slippery!</li>
        <li><strong>Sun protection</strong> - Hat, sunglasses, reef-safe sunscreen</li>
        <li><strong>Layers</strong> - Coastal mornings can be cool, especially in winter</li>
        <li><strong>Water and snacks</strong> - Low tides are often early morning, before breakfast</li>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> - Document what you see without disturbing it</li>
        <li><strong>Field guide</strong> - Optional, but helps identify species</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never turn your back on the ocean.</strong> Rogue waves can sweep you off rocks</li>
        <li><strong>Check tide times carefully.</strong> Make sure you have time to explore before the tide comes back in</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for slippery surfaces.</strong> Wet rocks and algae are extremely slippery</li>
        <li><strong>Be aware of weather.</strong> Storms can create dangerous conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Go with a buddy.</strong> Especially at remote locations</li>
    </ul>
